## How it works

This project is an 8-bit ripple carry parallel adder.
It takes two 8-bit binary numbers as inputs:
ui_in[7:0] → Operand A
uio_in[7:0] → Operand B
It adds them using a chain of 8 full adders, where each stage passes its carry to the next stage.
The final 8-bit sum is output on uo_out[7:0].
The final carry-out (Cout) is generated internally but not connected to an external pin in this version.

## How to test

You can test the design in simulation:
Run the provided testbench (tb.v).
The testbench applies different input combinations of A and B.
Example:
A = 00001100 (12)
B = 00000111 (7)
Sum = 00010011 (19)

## External hardware
No external hardware is required.
